# Keycloakify-tailwind

This project was normally intended for private use, but I decided to share it with the community.

This project is a fork from [Keycloakify-demo-app#look_and_feel](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app/tree/look_and_feel/src/KcApp) with all the default pages from [keycloakify/components](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/keycloakify/tree/main/src/lib/components)

I decided to go with the component level customization so that I have more control over the look and feel.
